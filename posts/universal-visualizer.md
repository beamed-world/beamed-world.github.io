We are now in the information age. It is estimated that the size of human
knowledge is doubling every 13-15 months. Compare this the early 19th and 20th
centuries, where the rate was estimated to lead to a doubling every 100 years.

Clearly something very profound is happening to the relationship between humans
and our knowledge of the environment we find ourselves in
